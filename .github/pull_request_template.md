- [ ] I asked [the AI](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) to briefly summarize, use and improve the feature(s), and I'm okay with the output:

>> Could you briefly summarize the following code for me?
>> ```python
>> class Tiger:
>>    def __init__(self, name):
>>       self.name = name
>>
>>    def roar(self):
>>       print(f"{self.name} lets out a powerful roar!")
>> ```

> This code defines a Python class named `Tiger` with a constructor that initializes the tiger's name, and a `roar` method that prints a message including the tiger's name. Simple and elegant, just like a tiger! 🐅
>
>> Could you show me how to use it?
>
> Sure, here's how to create and use a `Tiger` object with the class you have:
> ```python
> # Create an instance of Tiger
> my_tiger = Tiger("Gopal")
> 
> # Call the roar method
> my_tiger.roar()
> ```
>
> When you run this code, it will output:
> ```
> Gopal lets out a powerful roar!
> ```
>
> That's how you bring your Tiger to life! 🎉
>
>> Is there any way to do it better?
>
> Absolutely. You could add error handling, additional methods, or even inheritance. Here's an enhanced version:
> ```python
> class Tiger:
>     def __init__(self, name):
>         self.name = name
> 
>     def roar(self):
>         print(f"{self.name} lets out a powerful roar!")
> 
>     def introduce(self):
>         print(f"Meet {self.name}, the majestic tiger!")
>
> # Usage
> my_tiger = Tiger("Gopal")
> my_tiger.introduce()  # Output: Meet Gopal, the majestic tiger!
> my_tiger.roar()  # Output: Gopal lets out a powerful roar!
> ```
>
> Now your tiger can introduce itself, too. 🐯📢
